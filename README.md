# GLV-algorithm
This project is a common of Pierre-Emmanuel CLET and myself, Pierre-Augustin BERTHET. It was a part of our Master degree in Cryptology at Universit√© de Versailles Saint Quentin.

Gallant lambert vandstone algorithm for elliptic curves multiplication. 
This project studies the improvements in terms of complexity and speed of the GLV method compared to the more classic Double and Add algorithm for elliptic curves multiplication. It is in no way a secured way of implementing elliptic curves multiplication. 
Please also note that it's not fully optimised memory usage wise, as the code had to remain as clear as possible for evaluation by Michael Quisquarter and Yann Rotella.
